# Spotify Playlist Generator

## Overview

Spotify Playlist Generator is a web application that allows users to log in with their Spotify account, view their top tracks and saved tracks, and easily create custom playlists. The app uses the official Spotify Web API to fetch your personal music data and helps you generate playlists based on your listening habits.

## Features

- **Spotify Login:** Authenticate securely with your Spotify account.
- **Top Tracks:** View your most listened-to tracks.
- **Saved Tracks:** Access your favorite saved songs.
- **Playlist Creation:** Generate and save new playlists directly to your Spotify account.

## Access Requirements

Due to Spotify's developer restrictions, user management must be handled manually.  
If you are unable to access the app after authentication, please request access by sending an email to:

**alberto.bollino@outlook.it**

Your Spotify account will be added manually to the app's user list in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## How It Works

1. Click "Login with Spotify" to authenticate.
2. After logging in, you will be redirected to the app's main page.
3. Explore your top tracks and saved tracks.
4. Create new playlists with your favorite songs.

## Note

- Only users who have been manually added to the app's user list can access the app.
